## üìå Project Overview <br />
The developed Mule Process API exposes a RESTful API with endpoints to manage Care Benefit Verification records in Salesforce Health Cloud. It provides functionality to:
<br />
<br />
1. Accept requests to create Care Benefit Verification records.<br />
2. Retrieve all created Care Benefit Verification requests.<br />
3. Validate the requests against provided information and update them accordingly.<br />
<br />

## üèó Features
### API Endpoints 
1.POST /api/care-benefit-verification ‚Äì Creates a Care Benefit Verification request.<br />
2.GET /api/care-benefit-verification ‚Äì Retrieves all created Care Benefit Verification requests.<br />
3.Scheduler ‚Äì Executes periodically or can be triggered manually to validate and update requests.<br />

### Salesforce Integration 
- Used MuleSoft Built In Salesforce connector to connect with Salesforce Health Cloud.<br />
- Salesforce Bulk Data Load Jobs to process bulk number of records fastly.<br />
### Robust Error Handling 
- Making Use of Global Error Handler to capture the errors and give custom response back to the user along with Status Codes.<br />
### Data Validation
- Defined Request Body Schema in RAML with mandatory fields and data formats.<br />
- API Kit Router as first layer to identify the data Validation errors.<br />
### Security Measures
- HTTPS enformed for data transmission. Included key store certificate.<br />
- Encrypting the sensitive fields using secure property configurations(Blowfish Algorithm).<br />
- Included the sensitive environment varibles to be masked in mule-artifact.json<br />
- Applied Client-Id Enforcement and Rate Limiting policy. Used Auto discovery to bind the policies applied in API Manager.<br />
### Unit Test Cases.
- Created Munit Test Cases to ensure API reliability and correctness.
### Retry Mechanism
- Implemented Until Successsful and retry mechanism for handling transient Salesforce Connectivity Errors.
### Logging
- Utilized json logger module for capturing Logs as Structured JSON Object for easy readability.
### Cloud-hub Deployment
- Hosted the application in CloudHub 1.0.
### Salesforce Page Layouts and Objects Customization.
- Modified Page layouts to remove the irrelavent fields.
